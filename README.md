My version of the classic PongGame with tkinter as the only imported module

My thoughts on the challenge

The code

The code for this project is decent. There is alot of areas where i could imporve. For exemple i could combine diffrents if statements and made the board diffrently but i am happy since this was a challenge presented to me to finnish the project within 1 hour.

What i learned for the challenge

I learned that coding fast is good but you allways need to make sure the code is neatly writen and you dont overuse functions, loops and variables. The biggest thing i learned from this challenge is that writing code fast of the top of your head can work as a blueprint or a start to you project but should not be implemented inside the main file becouse the over usage och variables and statments.
